  <p class="prose-lead">Ubud is where slow travel becomes a lifestyle. I spent a month reflecting on architecture and intentionality while living in a traditional bamboo home, learning the rhythm of the local community and the art of presence.</p>

  <p>The morning light in Bali dictates the pace of the day. It taught me the importance of being fully present in a destination, a skill that translates directly to the attentive care and technical stewardship I provide on every sit.</p>

  <p>Exploring the intersection of ancient traditions and modern nomadic life has been a defining chapter of my global journey across 35+ countries and continues to influence my professional standards.</p>
