  <p class="prose-lead">Rover is a helpful tool when I have short gaps between my house sits. It allows me to find local pet care opportunities that do not necessarily require an overnight stay. It is a great way to meet more animals and help out pet owners in the local community.</p>

  <h2>Filling the gaps between sits</h2>
  <p>I use it to keep my schedule full and stay active with animals even when I am just passing through a city for a few days. It is reliable and the app makes communication with pet owners very easy and transparent.</p>

  <p>Whether you need someone to walk your dog or you are looking to earn a little extra while traveling, it is a solid platform that focuses on the well-being of the pets. While my primary stays are through long-term house sitting, having Rover as a backup ensures I'm never without a connection to the pet community.</p>
