  <p class="prose-lead">Understanding the different membership tiers for sitters on
  TrustedHousesitters is key to choosing the plan that fits your travel style and
  safety needs.</p>

  <p>TrustedHousesitters offers three main levels of membership specifically for 
  <strong>sitters</strong>: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Note that these are separate 
  from owner memberships; if you only intend to sit, ensure you are looking at the 
  sitter-specific pricing tiers.</p>

    <span class="prose-caption">Choosing the right sitter membership level depends on how often 
    you plan to sit and what level of safety net you require as a traveler.</span>
  </div>

  <h2>The Basic Sitter Plan</h2>
  <p>This is the entry-level plan for sitters. It gives you access to unlimited sits worldwide
  and allows you to build your professional sitter profile. It is the most affordable way to
  get started if you already have your own travel insurance and don't need the extra sitter
  perks.</p>

  <h2>The Standard Sitter Plan</h2>
  <p>The Standard plan is the most popular choice for active sitters. It includes everything in
  the Basic plan, plus <strong>Accident & Liability Protection</strong>, which is vital for
  peace of mind while you are in someone else's home. You also get access to a 24/7 Vet Line,
  an incredible resource when you're caring for animals in unfamiliar locations.</p>

  <h2>The Premium Sitter Plan</h2>
  <p>For full-time sitters and travelers, the Premium plan offers the highest level of security.
  It includes <strong>Sit Cancellation Insurance</strong>, which can help cover hotel costs if
  a homeowner cancels on you at the last minute. It also includes two global airport lounge
  passes, adding a touch of luxury to your transit days between sits.</p>
