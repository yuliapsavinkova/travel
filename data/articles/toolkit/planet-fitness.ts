  <p class="prose-lead">Staying healthy on the road can be a challenge. I use a Planet Fitness membership because they have locations in almost every major city I visit across the United States.</p>

  <h2>Routine and recovery</h2>
  <p>It gives me a consistent place to work out and just as importantly a reliable place to shower when I am driving between stays. The atmosphere is usually very welcoming and it is a nice way to maintain a routine no matter where I am in the country.</p>

  <p>It is one of the most practical investments for a full-time traveler. Having a "home base" gym that feels the same regardless of the state you are in provides a sense of comfort and stability.</p>
