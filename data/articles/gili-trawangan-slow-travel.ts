  <p class="prose-lead">After three months in Bali, I needed a break from the constant noise 
  of motorbikes. I chose Gili Trawangan for its slower pace and the unique absence of 
  motorized transport.</p>

  <p>The Gili islands feel like a world apart. You move between them by local boat, and 
  horses are still the primary way to move heavy goods. I visited during the off-season, 
  which meant fewer tourists and significant discounts on scuba courses and hotels. Even 
  the occasional rain felt like a welcome break from the heat.</p>

  <h2>Getting to the Islands</h2>
  <p>I took a boat from Sanur, leaving the crowds behind for something much smaller. When 
  I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the silence. Life on the island is dictated by 
  the water, and everything from beaches to dive centers is within easy walking distance.</p>

    <h3>Where to stay</h3>
    <p>I found that Booking.com offered the most reliable selection of clean, modern hotels 
    at great prices during the off-season. You can explore my recommended stays on their 
    platform to find the best local gems.</p>

  <h2>Life on Trawangan</h2>
  <p>The island is small enough to walk around entirely in about two hours. Beaches stretch 
  around the whole perimeter, so you are always close to the water. While Trawangan is 
  known for its nightlife, it is easy to find quiet spots if you look for them.</p>

  <h2>Learning to Dive</h2>
  <p>I didn't plan on getting scuba certified when I arrived. However, my hotel had a 
  training pool right in front where I watched groups of divers every morning over 
  breakfast. Eventually, it felt like the natural thing to do. The dive centers on the 
  island are professional and the water is incredibly clear, making it a perfect place to 
  learn.</p>

    <h3>Practical tips for your visit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bring some cash for local purchases, although ATMs are available</li>
      <li>Visit during the off-season if you want better deals and fewer crowds</li>
      <li>Pack reef-safe sunscreen and a good hat to protect yourself from the sun</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Gili Trawangan reset my pace. Learning to dive there was a spontaneous decision that 
  became a highlight of my time in Indonesia, simply because the environment allowed for 
  that kind of slow, intentional focus.</p>
