  <p class="prose-lead">After three months in Bali, I needed a break from the constant motorbike noise. I loved Bali, but the traffic never really stops. I chose Gili Trawangan for one simple reason: peace and a slower pace.</p>

  <p>The Gili islands—Trawangan, Meno, and Air—feel like a piece of heaven in the middle of nowhere. You can move between them cheaply by local boat, and horses are still used for transport. I happened to go off-season. Honestly, other than it being hot, I was glad: hotels and scuba courses had high discounts, there were fewer tourists, and rainy spells were actually nice breaks from the heat.</p>

  <h2>Getting to Gili Trawangan</h2>
  <p>I took a boat from Sanur. The ride itself felt like a transition, leaving crowds behind and heading somewhere smaller and slower. When I arrived on Trawangan, the first thing I noticed was the calm of island life. Hotels, beaches, and dive centers are all within walking distance.</p>

    <h3>Where to stay</h3>
    <p>I found that <strong>Booking.com</strong> offered the most reliable selection of modern, clean hotels at excellent prices, especially during the off-season. You can find my recommended stays <a href="https://www.booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--c-gold); text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Exploring the Island</h2>
  <p>Gili Trawangan is small. You can walk around the entire island in about 1–2 hours at a relaxed pace. Beaches stretch all the way around the island. You step out of your hotel and you are already close to the water. Trawangan is the largest island and has nightlife, but also quiet spots if you look for them.</p>

  <h2>Transport around the islands</h2>
  <p>Local boats connect all three Gili islands cheaply. On the islands themselves, horses (called <em>cidomos</em>) and bicycles are the main ways to get around. It's a surreal experience hearing the clip-clop of hooves instead of the roar of engines.</p>

  <h2>A spontaneous decision to learn scuba diving</h2>
  <p>I did not come to Gili Trawangan planning to get scuba certified. It happened on the spot. There were dive centers everywhere, and many of them looked surprisingly modern and professional for Southeast Asia.</p>

  <p>My hotel had a pool right in front, used for dive training. Breakfast was included, and every morning I watched groups of divers learning skills in the water. The ocean was just a few steps away. At some point, it felt obvious: this was the place to finally do it.</p>

  <h2>Snorkeling on Gili Trawangan</h2>
  <p>I snorkeled every day. You can snorkel directly from most beaches or join day trips to various reefs around the islands. The water is clear, the coral vibrant, and marine life easy to spot. Snorkeling trips are affordable and organized by many local operators.</p>

  <h2>Food and daily life</h2>
  <p>The food variety surprised me. For such a small island, the options were wide: local Indonesian food, fresh seafood, and international dishes. Eating out was easy and casual, and nights felt relaxed rather than rushed.</p>

    <h3>Practical tips for visiting Gili</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash:</strong> I never had problems with ATMs, but it is wise to bring some cash just in case.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Best time to visit depends on whether you want discounts (off-season) or reliable sunny weather (peak season).</li>
      <li><strong>Packing:</strong> Pack reef-safe sunscreen, water shoes, and a hat.</li>
      <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Off-season visits can be hot and rainy, but the discounts and fewer crowds make it worthwhile.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Gili Trawangan was not just a stop after Bali. It reset my pace. Learning to dive there felt natural because everything else was already slow, simple, and close to the water.</p>
