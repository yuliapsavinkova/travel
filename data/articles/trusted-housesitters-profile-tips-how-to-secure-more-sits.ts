  <p class="prose-lead">If you want to secure more sits on TrustedHousesitters, your profile needs to instantly build trust. Owners skim fast and decide even faster. Your goal is to look reliable, clear, and easy to say yes to.</p>

  <p>A strong profile makes an owner feel confident. They need to know they can hand you their keys and their beloved pets without worry. This isn't about telling your life story: it is about clarity and proof of responsibility.</p>

  <h2>1. Profile Photos: Get This Right First</h2>
  <p>Having good photos sets you up for success. Choose images that are clear and well lit. Owners often look at your photos before they read a single word of your bio.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Image rules for success:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show your face clearly in your main profile photo</li>
      <li>Include at least one photo of you with a pet (dog or cat both work)</li>
      <li><strong>Use a 3:2 aspect ratio:</strong> This ensures your images don't get cropped, rescaled, or blurry.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>What 3:2 means in practice:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: 900 × 600, 1500 × 1000, 3000 × 2000</li>
    <li>The width of your photo should always be 1.5 times the height</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you upload a square or vertical image, TrustedHousesitters will shrink it and it won’t display full-size. That immediately looks sloppy and unprofessional. authentic, well-lit photos with animals build immediate rapport.</p>

      alt="Sitter with a happy dog" />
    <span class="prose-caption">Clear, authentic photos with animals are your most powerful trust-building tool.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Additional photos to include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You interacting with animals (playing, walking, cuddling)</li>
    <li>Natural settings — homes, gardens, outdoors</li>
    <li>Real moments, not stiff selfies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You should have multiple photos. One looks incomplete; five to ten looks solid.</p>

  <h2>2. Profile Content: Write for Owners, Not for Yourself</h2>
  <p>Owners care about one thing: whether you can handle their home and their pet. Avoid generic travel manifestos and long childhood stories.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3 style="color: #ff6b6b; margin-top: 0;">What NOT to do:</h3>
    <ul style="opacity: 1;">
      <li>Long childhood stories about your first hamster</li>
      <li>Travel manifestos about your "soul searching" journey</li>
      <li>Philosophical paragraphs about freedom and life</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>What to do instead:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make it easy for an owner to picture you in their home</li>
    <li>Answer their unspoken questions quickly</li>
    <li>Focus on: What pets you’ve cared for, how you structure your day around animals, and what kind of sitter you are in practical terms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a sentence doesn’t help an owner trust you, cut it.</p>

  <h2>3. Responsibility and Cleanliness Matter More Than Personality</h2>
  <p>This matters more than personality. Be explicit. Don’t assume it’s obvious. Mention things like: you keep homes clean and organized, you follow feeding routines exactly, and you notice changes in pet behavior.</p>

  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "I leave homes as clean (or cleaner) than I found them. I stick closely to routines and instructions, treating someone else’s home with the same care as my own."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Vague praise doesn’t help. Specific behavior does. Mention if you are comfortable with medication or high-energy breeds if applicable.</p>

  <h2>4. Show Consistency, Availability, and Pet Coverage</h2>
  <p>Owners worry about flakiness. Help them relax by clarifying: Your typical length of sits (weekends vs long-term), whether you work remotely or are out during the day, and how often pets will be left alone.</p>
  
  <p>If you prefer long-term sits, say it. If you’re home most of the day, say it. <strong>Clarity beats flexibility here.</strong></p>

  <h2>5. Reviews and Experience: Build Credibility Fast</h2>
  <p>If you have reviews, reference them naturally and reinforce what owners already praised. If you are just starting out, the biggest challenge is <a href="/blog/how-to-get-your-first-house-sit-no-reviews">landing that first sit without any existing reviews</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Use external character references (landlords, employers, friends) to build that initial layer of trust. Everyone starts somewhere—what matters is how trustworthy you sound.</p>

  <h2>6. Make Your Profile Easy to Scan</h2>
  <p>Most owners are busy and will skim first. Use short paragraphs, clear sections, and straightforward language. Avoid walls of text. A clean, organized profile signals a clean and organized sitter.</p>

  <h2>7. Keep Your Profile Updated</h2>
  <p>An outdated profile looks abandoned. Update your bio when you complete new sits, add new photos of animals you've bonded with, and keep your availability calendar current. Even small updates signal that you are active and engaged.</p>
