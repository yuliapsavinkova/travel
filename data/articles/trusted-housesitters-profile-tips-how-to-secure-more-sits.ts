  <p class="prose-lead">If you want to secure more sits on TrustedHousesitters, your profile 
  needs to instantly build trust. Owners skim fast and decide even faster. Your goal is 
  to look reliable, clear, and easy to say yes to.</p>

  <p>A strong profile makes an owner feel confident. They need to know they can hand you 
  their keys and their beloved pets without worry. This isn't about telling your life 
  story: it is about clarity and proof of responsibility.</p>

  <h2>1. Profile Photos</h2>
  <p>Having good photos sets you up for success. Choose images that are clear and well lit. 
  Owners often look at your photos before they read a single word of your bio.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Image rules for success:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show your face clearly in your main profile photo</li>
      <li>Include at least one photo of you with a pet</li>
      <li>Use a 3:2 aspect ratio to ensure your images don't get cropped or blurry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>The width of your photo should be 1.5 times the height. Sloppy cropping makes you look 
  unprofessional, whereas clear, authentic photos with animals build immediate rapport. One 
  photo looks incomplete, so aim for five to ten solid images.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>2. Focus on Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Mention cleanliness and routines explicitly. Owners care about one thing above all 
  else: whether you can handle their home and their pet. Avoid long travel manifestos 
  and focus on your daily structure.</p>

  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "I leave homes cleaner than I found them. I follow feeding routines exactly and 
    treat every home with the same care as my own."
  </blockquote>

  <p>If you work remotely, mention it. Owners love knowing someone will be home for a 
  significant part of the day. Clarity about your schedule always beats general flexibility.</p>

  <h2>3. Build Credibility Fast</h2>
  <p>If you have reviews, reference what previous owners have praised. If you are just 
  starting out, use your experience with friends' pets or past rentals to show you are 
  responsible. Everyone starts somewhere, and confidence in your own ability goes a long way.</p>

  <h2>4. Make it Scanable</h2>
  <p>Use short paragraphs and clear sections. Most owners are busy and will skim your 
  profile first. A clean, organized profile signals a clean and organized sitter. Keep 
  your language straightforward and your information up to date.</p>
