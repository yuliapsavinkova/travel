  <p class="prose-lead">Your first house sit is the hardest one to get. After that, it gets exponentially easier. The reason most people never get past this stage isn’t lack of qualifications — it’s bad strategy.</p>

  <p>I got my first house sit with zero reviews by stacking the odds in my favor instead of competing where everyone else applies. Here’s exactly how I did it, step by step.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Why most beginners get stuck</h3>
    <p>New sitters usually fail because they target "dream" setups right away. They apply in popular destinations, during peak seasons, for long stays, or for high-maintenance dogs. Then they panic when no one responds.</p>
    <p><strong>That’s not a you problem. That’s a competition problem.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 1: Choose a high-demand, low-competition location</h2>
  <p>I intentionally chose Austin, Texas for my first sit. Not because it’s glamorous — but because it’s strategic. I applied during peak summer, when temperatures are brutal and many sitters avoid the area.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Start with cats and short sits</h2>
  <p>For your first sit, cats are easier than dogs and short stays are easier than long ones. Cats represent a lower perceived responsibility for homeowners—no rigid walking schedules or high-energy management.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Write an application that removes homeowner anxiety</h2>
  <p>Your message is not about convincing someone you’re amazing. It’s about making them feel calm about leaving.</p>
  
  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "Hi [Name], I saw your listing in Austin and would love to care for your cats while you’re away. I work remotely and am usually home, so they'd have consistent attention."
