  <p class="prose-lead">If you want more invites on TrustedHousesitters, your profile needs to instantly build trust. Owners skim fast. They decide faster. Your goal is simple: look reliable, clear, and easy to say yes to.</p>

  <p>A strong TrustedHousesitters profile does one thing well: it makes an owner feel trusted. Trusted enough to hand you their home and their pet. This isn’t about telling your life story — it’s about clarity, trust, and proof that you’re responsible.</p>

  <h2>1. TrustedHousesitters Profile Photos: Get This Right First</h2>
  <p>TrustedHousesitters is picky about images, and for good reason. Owners scan photos before they read a word.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Image rules that matter:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your main profile photo must show your face clearly</li>
      <li>Ideally, include your photo with a pet in it (dog or cat both work)</li>
      <li>Use a 3:2 aspect ratio — anything else gets cropped, rescaled, or blurry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><strong>What 3:2 means in practice:</strong> Examples include 900 × 600, 1500 × 1000, 3000 × 2000. Width should always be 1.5× the height. If you upload a square or vertical image, TrustedHousesitters will shrink it and it won’t display full-size. That immediately looks sloppy.</p>

    <span class="prose-caption">Authentic, well-lit photos with animals build immediate rapport with homeowners.</span>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Additional photos to include:</strong> You interacting with animals (playing, walking, cuddling), natural settings in homes or outdoors, and real moments, not stiff selfies. You should have multiple photos. One looks incomplete. Five to ten looks solid.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. Profile Content: Write for Owners, Not for Yourself</h2>
  <p>Owners care about one thing: whether you can handle their home and their pet.</p>

  <p><strong>What not to do:</strong> Long childhood stories, travel manifestos, or philosophical paragraphs about freedom and life. <strong>What to do instead:</strong> Make it easy for an owner to picture you in their home. Answer their unspoken questions quickly. Focus on what pets you’ve cared for, how you structure your day around animals, and what kind of sitter you are in practical terms.</p>

  <p>If a sentence doesn’t help an owner trust you, cut it.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Responsibility and Cleanliness Matter More Than Personality</h2>
  <p>This matters more than personality. Be explicit. Don’t assume it’s obvious.</p>

  <p><strong>Mention things like:</strong> You keep homes clean and organized, follow feeding routines exactly, notice changes in pet behavior, and are comfortable with medication if applicable.</p>

  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "I leave homes as clean (or cleaner) than I found them. I stick closely to routines and instructions, treating someone else’s home with the same care as my own."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Vague praise doesn’t help. Specific behavior does.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Show Consistency, Availability, and Pet Coverage</h2>
  <p>Owners worry about flakiness. Help them relax by clarifying your typical length of sits (weekends vs long-term), whether you work remotely, and how often pets will be left alone.</p>

  <p>If you prefer long-term sits, say it. If you’re home most of the day, say it. Clarity beats flexibility here.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Reviews and Experience: Build Credibility Fast</h2>
  <p>If you have reviews, reference them naturally and reinforce what owners already praised. If you don’t yet, use external experience like friends’ pets, past rentals, or house management. Be honest — but confident. Everyone starts somewhere. What matters is how trustworthy you sound.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Make Your Profile Easy to Scan</h2>
  <p>Most owners skim first, read later. Use short paragraphs, clear sections, and straightforward language. Avoid walls of text. A clean profile signals a clean sitter.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Keep Your Profile Updated</h2>
  <p>An outdated profile looks abandoned. Update when you complete new sits, get new photos, or your availability changes. Even small updates signal that you’re active and engaged.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Final Reality Check: What Actually Gets You Chosen</h3>
    <p>A great TrustedHousesitters profile isn’t about being impressive. It’s about being reassuring. Clear photos. Owner-focused writing. Obvious responsibility. That’s what actually gets invites.</p>
