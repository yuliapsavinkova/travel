  <p class="prose-lead">If you want more invites on TrustedHousesitters, your profile needs to instantly build trust. Owners skim fast. They decide faster.</p>

  <p>Your goal is simple: look reliable, clear, and easy to say yes to. A strong TrustedHousesitters profile does one thing well: it makes an owner feel trusted. Trusted enough to hand you their home and their pet. This isn’t about telling your life story — it’s about clarity, trust, and proof that you’re responsible.</p>

  <h2>1. TrustedHousesitters Profile Photos: Get This Right First</h2>
  <p>TrustedHousesitters is picky about images, and for good reason. Owners scan photos before they read a word.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Image rules that matter:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your main profile photo must show your face clearly</li>
      <li>Ideally, include your photo with a pet in it (dog or cat both work)</li>
      <li>Use a 3:2 aspect ratio — anything else gets cropped, rescaled, or blurry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>What 3:2 means in practice:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: 900 × 600, 1500 × 1000, 3000 × 2000</li>
    <li>The width should always be 1.5× the height</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you upload a square or vertical image, TrustedHousesitters will shrink it and it won’t display full-size. That immediately looks sloppy and unprofessional.</p>

  <div class="prose-image-block">

    <span class="prose-caption">Authentic, well-lit photos with animals build immediate rapport with homeowners.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Additional photos to include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You interacting with animals (playing, walking, cuddling)</li>
    <li>Natural settings — homes, gardens, outdoors</li>
    <li>Real moments, not stiff selfies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You should have multiple photos. One looks incomplete; five to ten looks solid.</p>

  <h2>2. TrustedHousesitters Profile Content: Write for Owners, Not for Yourself</h2>
  <p>Owners care about one thing: whether you can handle their home and their pet. Avoid long childhood stories or travel manifestos.</p>

  <h3>What to do instead:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make it easy for an owner to picture you in their home</li>
    <li>Answer their unspoken questions quickly</li>
    <li>Focus on: What pets you’ve cared for, how you structure your day around animals, and what kind of sitter you are in practical terms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a sentence doesn’t help an owner trust you, cut it.</p>

  <h2>3. Responsibility and Cleanliness Matter More Than Personality</h2>
  <p>This matters more than personality. Be explicit. Don’t assume it’s obvious. Mention things like: you keep homes clean and organized, you follow feeding routines exactly, and you notice changes in pet behavior.</p>

  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "I leave homes as clean (or cleaner) than I found them. I stick closely to routines and instructions, treating someone else’s home with the same care as my own."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Vague praise doesn’t help. Specific behavior does.</p>

  <h2>4. Show Consistency, Availability, and Pet Coverage</h2>
  <p>Owners worry about flakiness. Help them relax by clarifying: Your typical length of sits (weekends vs long-term), whether you work remotely or are out during the day, and how often pets will be left alone. Clarity beats flexibility here.</p>

  <h2>5. Reviews and Experience: How to Build Credibility Fast</h2>
  <p><strong>If you have reviews:</strong> Reference them naturally and reinforce what owners already praised. <strong>If you don’t yet:</strong> Use external experience (friends’ pets, past rentals, house management). Be honest — but confident. Everyone starts somewhere. What matters is how trustworthy you sound.</p>

  <h2>6. Make Your TrustedHousesitters Profile Easy to Scan</h2>
  <p>Most owners skim first, read later. Use short paragraphs, clear sections, and straightforward language. Avoid walls of text. A clean profile signals a clean sitter.</p>

  <h2>7. Keep Your TrustedHousesitters Profile Updated</h2>
  <p>An outdated profile looks abandoned. Update when you complete new sits, get new photos, or your availability changes. Even small updates signal that you’re active and engaged.</p>
