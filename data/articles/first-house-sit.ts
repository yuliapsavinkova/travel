  <p class="prose-lead">Your first house sit is the hardest one to get. After that, it gets exponentially easier. The reason most people never get past this stage isn’t lack of qualifications — it’s bad strategy.</p>

  <p>I got my first house sit with zero reviews by stacking the odds in my favor instead of competing where everyone else applies. Here’s exactly how I did it, step by step.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Why most beginners get stuck</h3>
    <p>New sitters usually fail because they target "dream" setups right away. They apply in popular destinations, during peak seasons, for long stays, or for high-maintenance dogs. Then they panic when no one responds.</p>
    <p><strong>That’s not a you problem. That’s a competition problem.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 1: Choose a high-demand, low-competition location</h2>
  <p>I intentionally chose Austin, Texas for my first sit. Not because it’s glamorous — but because it’s strategic. I applied during peak summer, when temperatures are brutal and many sitters avoid the area.</p>
  <p>At the same time, Austin has a large and highly mobile tech community, which means people travel frequently, often on short notice, even during off-season months. Fewer sitters + plenty of homeowners = opportunity.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Start with cats and short sits</h2>
  <p>For your first sit, cats are easier than dogs and short stays are easier than long ones. Cats represent a lower perceived responsibility for homeowners—no rigid walking schedules or high-energy management. Short sits (2–5 days) are a lower risk and an easier "yes" for someone choosing a sitter without reviews.</p>
  <p>My first sit was 2 days and 2 cats. That’s the ideal entry point.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: Apply selectively — not massively</h2>
  <p>High-quality applications beat volume. I applied to only 3 sits total, not 50. One of those three accepted me. That conversion rate is not luck — it’s positioning. I didn't spray and pray; I chose sits where my background specifically fit the homeowner's needs.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Write an application that removes homeowner anxiety</h2>
  <p>Your message is not about convincing someone you’re amazing. It’s about making them feel calm about leaving. Here’s the framework I used:</p>
  
  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "Hi [Name], I saw your listing in Austin and would love to care for your cats while you’re away. I work remotely and am usually home, so they’d have consistent attention. I’ve spent a lot of time around cats and am very comfortable with feeding routines and respecting their space."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Step 5: Expect rejection — it’s normal</h2>
  <p>Even with a solid application, you will get declined. Someone else applied earlier, or they chose a returning sitter. Most people quit too early because they assume silence means failure. It doesn't. It just means the timing wasn't right for that specific home.</p>

  <h2>Step 6: Once you get one sit, momentum kicks in</h2>
  <p>After my first sit, I received my first review and homeowners started responding significantly more. Longer sits became realistic and the entire platform felt different. House sitting has a clear snowball effect. The first sit is simply the entry point.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>My exact first-sit timeline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created my professional profile</li>
      <li>Applied to 3 local cat sits</li>
      <li>Accepted for a 2-day sit</li>
      <li>Completed the sit successfully</li>
      <li>Received my first positive review immediately after</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Final advice</h2>
  <p>If you want your first house sit faster: Apply off-season, avoid over-saturated destinations, choose cats over dogs, and write calm, specific messages. This isn’t luck — it’s strategy.</p>
