  <p class="prose-lead">Your first house sit is the hardest one to secure. After that, it gets 
  exponentially easier. The reason most people never get past this stage is not a lack of 
  qualifications, but rather a flawed strategy.</p>

  <p>I landed my first sit with zero reviews by stacking the odds in my favor. Instead of 
  competing where everyone else was applying, I looked for specific opportunities. Here is 
  exactly how I did it.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>Why most beginners get stuck</h3>
    <p>New sitters usually fail because they target dream setups right away. They apply in 
    peak season for high-demand dogs in popular cities. When they don't get a response, 
    they assume the platform doesn't work.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 1: Choose a strategic location</h2>
  <p>I intentionally chose Austin, Texas for my first sit. I applied during the peak of 
  summer when the temperatures are brutal and many sitters avoid the area. Austin has a 
  large, mobile tech community where people travel frequently on short notice. A high 
  number of homeowners combined with fewer active sitters created my first big 
  opportunity.</p>
  
  <p>This strategy works best when you look for hot cities in summer, cold cities in winter, 
  or locations that aren't considered Instagram-famous. You don’t need Paris for your 
  first sit. You need a place other sitters are skipping.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Start with cats and short stays</h2>
  <p>For your first sit, cats are often a better entry point than dogs. They represent a 
  lower perceived responsibility for the homeowner. There are no rigid walking schedules 
  or high-energy needs to manage, which makes homeowners more flexible with new sitters.</p>

  <p>I also recommend starting with short sits of two to five days. These represent less 
  commitment and lower risk for the owner. My first sit lasted only two days. It was for 
  two cats while the owner visited parents a few hours away. That short weekend was the 
  ideal bridge to my first verified review.</p>

    <span class="prose-caption">Starting with feline care is one of the most effective 
    ways to build your initial reputation.</span>
  </div>

  <h2>Step 3: Write to remove anxiety</h2>
  <p>Your application message is not about convincing someone you are amazing. It is about 
  making them feel calm about leaving their home. You want to address their specific 
  situation directly.</p>
  
  <blockquote class="prose-quote">
    "I work remotely and am usually home, so your pets will have consistent attention 
    and care. I am very comfortable with feeding routines and respecting a home's 
    specific rules."
  </blockquote>

  <p>This approach works because it is calm and specific. It reduces the perceived risk 
  for the homeowner without overselling yourself. Once you get that first sit and a 
  verified review, your momentum will take over.</p>

  <h2>Final advice</h2>
  <p>If you want to move faster, apply off-season and choose cats over dogs. Write 
  specific, calm messages and be selective about where you apply. This isn't a 
  matter of luck: it is a matter of positioning yourself where you are most needed.</p>
