  'house sitting, minimalism, and intentional travel.';

  <p>I focus on long-term house sits, often staying for a month or more at a time. This allows 
  me to fully immerse myself in new surroundings without the stress of constant moving. For 
  me, travel is about settling in and understanding the rhythm of a place.</p>
  
  <p>This site is a practical guide to the lifestyle I’ve built. I share exactly how to get 
  your first house sit, what you should expect during a stay, and how to navigate solo travel 
  safely. It also explores the philosophy of intentional living: focusing on what really 
  matters while letting go of the rest.</p>

  <h2>Why Trust This Site</h2>
  <p>Everything you read here is based on real, lived experience. I don't write about theories 
  or sponsored trips. I focus on what works, what doesn’t, and who this lifestyle is actually 
  for. House sitting involves significant responsibility, and I value planning and respect 
  for every home and pet I care for.</p>
  
  <p>I am currently documenting my journey and expanding this space to share deeper insights 
  on minimalist living and slow travel. These approaches to freedom and happiness go hand 
  in hand, and I invite you to check back often as I document more of my stories and 
  technical hacks.</p>
