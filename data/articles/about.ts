  'Hi, I’m Yulia. I travel full-time across the U.S., living a lifestyle that blends house sitting, minimalism, and intentional travel.';

export const body = `
  <p>I focus on long-term house sits, often monthly stays, so I can fully immerse myself in the surroundings without the hassle of constant moving.</p>
  
  <p>This site is primarily a practical guide to house sitting — how to get your first sit, what to expect, and how to do it safely. It also explores ways to travel intentionally, live more freely, and focus on what really matters in life, with topics expanding as the site grows.</p>

  <h2>Why Trust This Site</h2>
  <p>Everything here is based on real experience, not theory or sponsored trips. I write about what works, what doesn’t, and who this lifestyle is actually for. House sitting involves responsibility, planning, and respect for other people’s homes and pets.</p>
  
  <p>I also share insights on minimalist living, slow travel, and intentional lifestyles, practical and philosophical approaches to freedom and happiness go hand in hand.</p>
