  <p class="prose-lead">“Free travel” sounds like influencer bait and in most cases, it is. 
  House sitting is different, but only if you understand the math, the tradeoffs, 
  and the actual constraints of the lifestyle.</p>

  <p>This article breaks down exactly when house sitting is effectively free, when it’s 
  not, and why most people fail to make it work. Accommodation is typically 40–70% of 
  travel costs. Removing it changes everything.</p>

  <div class="prose-accent-box">
    <h3>What “Free Travel” Actually Means (And Doesn't)</h3>
    <p><strong>It does NOT mean:</strong> Free flights, luxury vacations on demand, 
    or zero responsibility.</p>
    <p><strong>It DOES mean:</strong> $0 accommodation costs, stable housing while 
    traveling, and predictable food/living expenses instead of nightly hotel rates.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Scenario #1: The Slow Traveler (1–2 Sits/Month)</h2>
  <p>This is the most common path for digital nomads. You spend a few weeks in one 
  location before moving on.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Assumption:</strong> 14 nights per sit, 10 months per year.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotel alternative ($100/night):</strong> $14,000 total.</li>
    <li><strong>Membership cost:</strong> ~$200.</li>
    <li><strong>Net savings:</strong> ~$13,800/year.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even if you spend $2,000 extra on transport and occasional buffer hotels, you 
  are still over $10k ahead compared to traditional travel.</p>

  <h2>Scenario #2: Full-Time Nomad (365 Days)</h2>
  <p>Skeptics usually say: “Sure, but you’ll never cover the whole year.” In practice, 
  many sitters do—especially if they are flexible with location and 
  <a href="/blog/how-to-get-your-first-house-sit-no-reviews">apply strategically</a>.</p>

        <p class="serif-italic">Saved every single year.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Scenario #3: My Actual Experience</h2>
  <p>In the last 6 months (180 days), I paid for just 6 nights of hotels—and that was 
  mostly by choice, not necessity. This is the part most people miss: House sitting 
  compounds. The longer you do it and the stronger your reviews, the easier it becomes 
  to string sits together back-to-back.</p>

  <h2>The Hidden Costs</h2>
  <p>House sitting is not magic. Costs still exist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Flights or fuel costs remain your responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> Applying for sits and managing your profile takes effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> You have fixed dates and pet responsibilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="prose-accent-box variant-cons">
    <h3>Why Most People Fail</h3>
    <p>They treat it like Airbnb. They apply late, only want the top-tier "Instagram" 
    cities, or have weak profiles. Success rewards flexibility, reliability, and 
    clear communication.</p>
  </div>

  <p>So, is it really “free travel”? If by “free” you mean no accommodation costs and 
  radically cheaper long-term travel, then <strong>absolutely</strong>. It doesn't 
  make you rich; it makes travel sustainable.</p>
