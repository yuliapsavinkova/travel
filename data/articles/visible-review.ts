  <p class="prose-lead">Working while traveling requires a reliable internet connection. Visible is the phone plan I use because it offers unlimited data and a mobile hotspot that actually works across the country.</p>

  <h2>Staying connected on the road</h2>
  <p>In my experience, having a predictable monthly cost and the ability to work from almost anywhere makes it an essential part of my resources. I do not have to worry about data caps or finding public WiFi when I am in a new location.</p>

  <p>It uses a major network so the coverage is excellent even in more remote areas. For a digital nomad or anyone living a mobile lifestyle, having one less thing to worry about is a huge relief. Whether I'm in a rural farmhouse or a city apartment, my hotspot is my safety net.</p>
