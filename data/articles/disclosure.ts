  <p class="prose-lead">Transparency is the foundation of the Sitter Journey community. This 
  page explains how I handle resource and affiliate relationships on this site.</p>

  <h2>Resources vs. Affiliates</h2>
  <p>Currently, many of the links in my resources (like TrustedHousesitters) are 
  <strong>Resource Links</strong>. I do not receive cash payments for these. Instead, they 
  operate on a "Give One, Get One" model. For example, you receive a discount on your 
  membership, and I receive a credit (like a free month) added to mine.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Affiliate Links</strong> are slightly different and involve a cash commission 
  paid by a brand. While I may incorporate these in the future to help cover site hosting 
  and photography costs, my current focus is solely on the resource programs I personally 
  use every day.</p>

  <h2>Why I Disclose Both</h2>
  <p>Whether it is a free month of service or a small commission, the law (FTC) and search 
  engines (Google) require disclosure of any "material connection." This ensures you know 
  exactly when a recommendation might be incentivized.</p>

  <h2>My Commitment to You</h2>
  <p>I completed dozens of house sits across the United States before I ever shared a single 
  link. My reputation as a professional steward is my most valuable asset. I will 
  <strong>never</strong> recommend a tool, resource, or membership that I don't personally 
  use and trust, regardless of the referral benefit.</p>
