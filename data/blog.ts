    body: txt(`Entering the luxury housesitting market is a masterclass in professional branding. I started by treating my profile not as a traveler's bio, but as an estate manager's resume, highlighting technical oversight and specific medical care capabilities that high-value homeowners prioritize.

Vetting homeowners is just as important as being vetted yourself. I always look for platforms that offer comprehensive insurance and a verified identity system to ensure the safety of both the property and the sitter during long-term seasonal stays.

Joining the right community is the shortcut to success. You can start your own professional journey by joining TrustedHousesitters with a 25% discount using my vetted link below to ensure you have the best start possible.`),

    body: txt(`Modern residency stewardship is increasingly defined by its digital infrastructure. As homes become "smarter," the responsibility of the house sitter evolves to include technical oversight of security grids, environmental controls, and automated landscaping systems.

My protocol includes a detailed technical walkthrough of Nest, Ring, and Lutron systems before any sit begins. Ensuring these tools remain online and correctly calibrated is essential for maintaining property security and energy efficiency during month-long homeowner absences.

To maintain 24/7 connectivity for these systems and my daily updates, I rely on the unlimited nomadic data provided by Visible, ensuring I can monitor and update homeowners regardless of the property's local Wi-Fi status.`),

My redundant safety kit includes a 24/7 accessible membership like Planet Fitness for safe harbor on travel days and a high-bandwidth data plan through Visible to ensure I am never truly "off-grid" while navigating between states.

Building your nomadic life on a foundation of trust starts with vetting your platforms. I recommend starting with TrustedHousesitters for secure, community-vetted stays across the United States that provide a safe and stable environment.`),

    body: txt(`Specializing in senior pet care requires more than just affection; it requires clinical precision. I utilize digital medical logs to track every dose of insulin or oral medication, providing homeowners with data-backed peace of mind that their companions are thriving.

Patience is the core of palliative care. I spend significant time bonding with senior pets, respecting their specific mobility needs and ensuring their environment remains stress-free and familiar while their family is away.

If you need localized backup during a transition sit or a verified professional in a pinch, I recommend using Rover to find vetted pet professionals who share this commitment to high-standard care.`),

Communication in a crisis must be immediate and clear. Having an unlimited data plan via Visible allows me to provide real-time video consultations with owners or clinics during stressful situations, ensuring the best decisions are made quickly.

By treating housesitting as a professional stewardship, I ensure that the unexpected is managed with a calm, pre-determined plan that protects the pets and the property.`),
