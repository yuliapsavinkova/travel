      <p class="prose-lead">Getting your first house sit is the hardest part of the entire process. Not because it’s impossible — but because people overcomplicate it, apply in the wrong places, and assume rejection means failure. <strong>It doesn’t.</strong></p>

      <p>I got my first sit with zero reviews, by being strategic instead of optimistic. Most people approach housesitting as a vacation search. I approached it as a <strong>stewardship audition.</strong></p>

      <div class="prose-accent-box">
        <h3>The Beginner's Trap</h3>
        <p>Most beginners fail because they target "dream" setups right away. They apply for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-tier destinations like NYC, London, or Paris</li>
          <li>Long-term assignments (over 2 weeks)</li>
          <li>High-maintenance breeds that require specialized care</li>
          <li>Peak travel seasons (Christmas, Summer Break)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your goal is not to win these sits yet. Your goal is to win a <strong>review.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <h2>Step 1: The High-Demand, Low-Competition Filter</h2>
      <p>This matters more than your profile. I deliberately chose <strong>Austin, Texas</strong> during the peak of summer. Why? Because while it's brutally hot and most travelers are looking for coastal breezes, homeowners in Austin are still traveling, and the sitter pool is 80% smaller.</p>

        <span class="prose-caption">Strategically picking locations during off-peak times is how you build your initial trust foundation.</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Step 2: Cats and Short Sits (The "Low Risk" Entry)</h2>
      <p>For your very first sit, <strong>cats > dogs. Always.</strong> Cats represent a lower perceived risk for homeowners. There are no multiple daily walks, and the care routines are generally simpler. Homeowners are far more willing to "take a chance" on a review-less sitter if the job is straightforward.</p>
      
      <p>Short sits (2–5 days) are even more important. It’s a fast "yes" for a homeowner and, more importantly, a fast review for you. You can stack three short sits in a month and suddenly have more reviews than someone who did one 30-day sit.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Step 3: The Communication Framework</h2>
      <p>I applied to only 3 sits total, rather than "spraying and praying." My message was focused entirely on the homeowner's peace of mind, not my travel dreams.</p>
      
      <blockquote class="prose-quote">
        "I saw your listing for [Pet Names] and would love to provide them with consistent companionship while you're away. As a remote professional, I will be home most of the time, ensuring their routine remains undisturbed."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Step 4: The Snowball Effect</h2>
      <p>Once you get that first sit, everything changes. I got my first review, and suddenly my response rate tripled. Within two months, I was being invited to multi-week stays in high-value properties. <strong>The first sit is simply the gate.</strong></p>
